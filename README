Usage: gpw n, to generate n passwords

Notes for those compiling from source
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If compiling from source, you need a C++ compiler. I had to install the package

gcc-c++

in my case even though I already had gcc installed.

Also note that a "bare word" dictionary is assumed to be at

 /usr/share/dict/linux.words

Update the Makefile if yours is in a different path.
